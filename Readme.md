# How to load an XtraSchedulerReport from template


<p>This example demonstrates how the report can be created from the template and bound to data without having the SchedulerControl to appear.<br />
The SchedulerStorage object is created in code,  bound to data and used as the data source for the report's print adapter. The XtraSchedulerReport  is created in code, loads a previously constructed template and is linked to the SchedulerStorage via the SchedulerStoragePrintAdapter.</p>
